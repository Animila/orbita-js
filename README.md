## ## Orbital-js

Orbital-js is a free and open source application for creating a personal blog with a subscription.

(original project - [bezumkin/orbita](https://github.com/bezumkin/orbita) )

This fork of the project was made to transfer the project to the Node JS ecosystem.

TODO List:
1. Switch most systems to Fastify JS
2. Allocate to microservices
3. Implement a convenient platform configuration editor without changing the code (for example, adding new login methods)
5. Cubernetes :D
4. Transfer of the front to React Native? Flutter?
5. Profit?

Is mostly a project [bezumkin](https://github.com/bezumkin)

!!!Made for the sake of experiment and hypothesis testing!!!
